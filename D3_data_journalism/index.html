          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>In recent decades, healthcare has become a major concern for the U.S. population, due to high costs and longer
            life expectancies. A study was commissioned to ascertain the links between variables associated with healthcare
            and financial well-being. Values were obtained from all 50 states.
          </p>

          <p>The results of the study showed that certain factors correlated well, while others didn't. The following showed
            correlations, indicating that further studies might be worthwhile.
            <br>
            <br>
            -Population without Healthcare (%) vs Poverty (%) (Positive Correlation)<br><br>
            -Smokers (%) vs Median Household Income (%) (Negative Correlation)<br><br>
            -Smokers (%) vs Poverty (%) (Negative Correlation)<br><br>
            -Obesity (%) vs Median Household Income (%) (Negative Correlation)<br><br>
          </p>

          <p>The data would suggest that the way to improve health outcomes (as indicated by the healthcare, smoker, & obesity
            (%s)) is to improve the financial well-being of a state's populace. However, further studies are needed to strengthen
            this conclusion.
